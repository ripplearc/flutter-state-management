description: A new Flutter project.

publish_to: 'none' # Remove this line if you wish to publish to pub.dev

# When you rebuild the app for Android,
# any updates in the version number from the pubspec file will update
# the versionName and versionCode in the local.properties file.
#
# The version number is three numbers separated by dots,
# such as 1.0.0 in the example above, followed by an optional build number
# such as 1 in the example above, separated by a +.
#
# Both the version and the build number can be overridden in Flutter’s build by
# specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
#
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# For more information, check out Version your app in the Android documentation.
# Override: BUILD_NUMBER=[#] bundle exec fastlane android deploy
